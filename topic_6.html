                <p>If you‚Äôre in need of better sleep, it may be time to consider your sleep hygiene ‚Äî and how your habits may be preventing you from getting the quality sleep you need.</p><br>

                <h2>What is Sleep Hygiene?</h2>
                <p>‚ÄòSleep hygiene‚Äô refers to <mark id="m4">healthy habits, behaviours and environmental factors</mark> that can be adjusted to help you have a good night‚Äôs sleep. Some sleeping problems are often caused by <mark id="m4">bad sleep habits</mark> reinforced over years or even decades. </p><br>
                <p>There are many medications which are used to <mark id="m4">treat insomnia</mark> , but these tend to be only effective in the <mark id="m4">short-term.</mark> Ongoing use of sleeping pills may lead to dependence and interfere with developing good sleep habits independent of medication, thereby <mark id="m4">prolonging sleep difficulties.</mark> Talk to your health professional about <mark id="m4">what is right for you</mark> , but we recommend good sleep hygiene as an important part of treating insomnia, either with other strategies such as medication or cognitive therapy or alone. </p><br>
                <p>Your behaviors during the day ‚Äî not just before you go to bed ‚Äî can affect how well you sleep. This can include:</p>
                <p>- food and drink choices</p>
                <p>- schedule</p>
                <p>- evening routine </p><br>
                <p>In many cases, you can <mark id="m4">improve your sleep quality</mark> by making a few adjustments to lifestyle and attitude.</p>

                <h2>Why Is Sleep Hygiene Important?</h2>
                <img src="image/Topic6.png">
                <p>Sleep hygiene is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being, <mark id="m4">impacting both physical and mental aspects</mark> of life. Quality sleep supports the <mark id="m4">body's repair processes</mark> , bolsters immune function, and helps <mark id="m4">regulate hormones</mark> that control appetite, growth, and stress.</p><br>
                <p>Adequate sleep enhances <mark id="m4">cognitive functions</mark> such as memory, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making, which are essential for productivity and performance in daily activities. <mark id="m4">Emotional well-being</mark> is also tied to good sleep, as poor sleep can lead to <mark id="m4">irritability, increased stress</mark> , and a higher risk of anxiety and depression.</p><br>
                <p>Furthermore, proper sleep hygiene helps <mark id="m4">prevent chronic conditions</mark> like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, and reduces the risk of accidents by <mark id="m4">improving motor skills and reaction times.</mark> By promoting better interactions and social relationships, sleep hygiene contributes to a higher quality of life. Ultimately, consistent practice of good sleep habits leads to <mark id="m4">long-term health benefits,</mark> making it a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                <p id="p11">üí§Create a Bedtime Routine</p>
                <p>Establishing a bedtime routine helps <mark id="m4">signal to your body</mark> that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. This routine should involve <mark id="m4">relaxing activities</mark> , such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretching or yoga.</p><br>
                <p id="p11">üìµLimit Screen Time</p>
                <p>The <mark id="m4">blue light emitted</mark> by screens, such as phones, tablets, computers, and TVs, can interfere with the production of the <mark id="m4">sleep hormone melatonin</mark> , making it harder to fall asleep. Avoiding screens <mark id="m4">at least an hour before bed</mark> allows your body to naturally wind down and prepare for sleep.</p><br>
                <p id="p11">üõåüèªMake Your Bedroom Comfortable</p>
                <p>Your sleep environment plays a significant role in the quality of your sleep. Ensure your <mark id="m4">mattress and pillows are comfortable</mark> , the room temperature is conducive to sleep (cool but not too cold), and there are <mark id="m4">minimal distractions</mark> or disruptions.</p><br>
                <p id="p11">‚òïLimit Alcohol and Caffeine</p>
                <p>Both alcohol and caffeine can <mark id="m4">disrupt your sleep patterns</mark>. Avoid consuming caffeine <mark id="m4">after mid-afternoon</mark> , and limit alcohol intake, especially close to bedtime, to promote better sleep quality.</p><br><br>
